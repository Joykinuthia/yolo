# Implementation Reasoning and Objectives

This document provides a detailed explanation for the design and implementation choices made in the containerization and orchestration of the yolo application using Docker and Docker Compose. Each objective is addressed below:

## 1. Choice of the Base Image for Each Container
- **Backend**: The backend Dockerfile uses `node:18-alpine` for the build stage due to its lightweight nature and security updates. The final image is based on `alpine:3.18` with Node.js installed, minimizing the attack surface and image size for production.
- **Frontend**: The frontend build uses `node:18-alpine` for building the React app, then switches to `nginx:alpine` for serving static files. This is a best practice for React apps, as Nginx is optimized for static content delivery and is lightweight.
- **Database**: The MongoDB service uses the official `mongo:6` image, ensuring compatibility and reliability.

## 2. Dockerfile Directives Used
- **Multi-stage builds** are used in both backend and frontend Dockerfiles to reduce final image size and separate build dependencies from runtime.
- **WORKDIR** sets the working directory for commands, improving clarity and security.
- **COPY** and **RUN** are used to install dependencies and copy source code.
- **EXPOSE** declares the ports the container listens on.
- **CMD** specifies the default command to run the application.
- **ENV** sets environment variables for configuration.

## 3. Docker Compose Networking
- **Bridge Network**: All services are attached to a custom bridge network (`yolo-network`) for isolated communication and security.
- **Port Allocation**: Each service exposes only the necessary ports (`27017` for MongoDB, `5000` for backend, `80` for frontend mapped to host `3000`). This prevents port conflicts and ensures proper routing.
- **depends_on**: Ensures service startup order (frontend waits for backend, backend waits for database).

## 4. Docker Compose Volume Definition and Usage
- **MongoDB Data Persistence**: A named volume (`mongo-data`) is defined and mounted to `/data/db` in the MongoDB container, ensuring data persists across container restarts and recreations.
- **No volumes for frontend/backend**: As these are stateless, no persistent volumes are required.

## 5. Git Workflow
- **Branching**: Feature branches are used for new features and fixes, merged into `master` via pull requests.
- **Commits**: Descriptive commit messages are used for traceability.
- **.gitignore**: Ensures node_modules and build artifacts are not committed.
- **Tagging**: Releases are tagged for versioning, matching Docker image tags for consistency.

## 6. Successful Running and Debugging
- **Testing**: Containers are run and tested locally using `docker-compose up`.
- **Debugging**: Common issues (port conflicts, missing dependencies, build errors) are resolved by checking logs (`docker-compose logs <service>`), rebuilding images, and ensuring environment variables are set.
- **Healthchecks**: Can be added for production readiness.

## 7. Good Practices
- **Image Tag Naming**: Images are tagged with semantic versions (e.g., `joyrose/yolo-backend:1.0.0`) for clarity and traceability.
- **Security**: Use of minimal base images and environment variables.
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive README and comments in Dockerfiles.
- **Automated Builds**: Can be set up via CI/CD for consistency.

## 8. DockerHub Screenshot
A screenshot (`image.png`) is included in the repository root, showing the deployed image on DockerHub with its version tag clearly visible.
